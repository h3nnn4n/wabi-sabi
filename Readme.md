# WABI-SABI 侘寂

Wabi-Sabi is a japanese [word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi) for the
aesthetics of that which is "imperfect, impermanent, and
incomplete". Here, I take this as an a interpretation of keeping habits as a
way of trying to improve an imperfect self, where despite the work, in the end
the results will be flawed. Despite this, it has value and crafted character.

This is a simple and minimalist Habit Tracker. It is also a learning experience
of working with django. Dont expect the app to work reliably, consistently or
have constant uptime. It lacks some basic features (such as deleting).
Code-wise, it is a bit all over the place, while I figure django out.
